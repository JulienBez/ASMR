# ASMR_CATCHPHRASE

This branch homes a tuned version of the ASMR algorithm. It was designed to run efficiently on the catchphrase dataset. It features a loop whose goal is to test different combinations of parameters efficiently. It can not be executed through previously established command lines. We will release a documentation for this version soon.
